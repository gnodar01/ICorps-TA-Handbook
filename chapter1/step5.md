## Step 5: Selection Process

Each cohort’s applicant teams will be selected down to 8-9 final teams. There will be a selection committee who will be comprised of experienced entrepreneurs, VCs, business leaders, etc. Teams will present their innovations/technologies to the selection committee, who will then select the top 8 or 9 to take part in I-Corps. 

### Initial Applicant Selection

* The final selection committee should receive approximately 16 applicant teams, so that they may narrow down to 8 or 9 final teams.

* If there are more than 16 applications received during a cohort, I-Corps staff should review and select 16 "semi-finalist teams" to move on to the selection process.

    * There should be several teams chosen as "backup teams", in case any of the selected 16 teams drop out or are unable to commit.

* If less than 16 complete team applications are received, there will need to be a discussion on whether a selection committee will be needed.

### Applicant preparation

* Teams will need to prepare a powerpoint presentation to present to the selection committee.

* Teams will need to be provided with an outline for the presentation, and the judging rubric that will be used in the final selection process.

* Teams should be given a date

* I-Corps staff should work with teams to review and give advice on each team’s presentation, leading up to the final selection process.

### Selection Committee

* Make sure a date is picked for the final selection process, and that a room is booked. The room should be large enough to fit the selection committee, the presenting team, and I-Corps staff. The room should also have A/V equipment.

* Each team will need to have a time slot reserved for them; e-mail each team with the date, location, and time of their presentation.

* Make sure there will be food and drinks available for the selection committee.

* Make sure the individuals comprising the selection committee are finalized. Typically the selection committee is put together by a member of the Teaching Team.

* Each member of the selection committee should be e-mailed the date for the final selection process, the location of the room, the rubric which they will be using to judge teams, and a list of the presenting teams, along with each team’s application.

* Before selection day, make sure all of the presentations from the teams have been received.

* On selection day, before the committee arrives, check all equipment, and load all presentations.

* Keeping time for the presentations will be important. Keep teams and the selection committee aware of the time, and make sure it is being adhered to.
