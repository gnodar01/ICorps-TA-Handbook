### Collection

Each team will receive $2,600 for their customer discovery and MVP development. There are several documents that the teams must fill out in order to participate in the program, and to receive funding

* Immediately after the final 8-9 teams are chosen by the selection committee, they (mentor included) should be e-mailed with a package of documents, including a description of which individuals in the team need to submit which documents.

    * Documents that need to be collected:

        * PI will need to submit a PTF form, online in ARGIS

            * Teams can be sent a PT

        * PI will need to sign an award notice

            * An award notice will need to be customized for each team using the Award Notice Template: Fill in recipients (team member names), Period of Performance dates, and the Project ID (Cohort # - Team #)

                * The period of performance should be from the day of the workshop (cohort start date) to the last day in which teams can withdraw funds from their accounts (should be several months after final presentation day to allow time for teams to spend money)

        * Each member of the team (including PI) will need to sign and submit a Participation Agreement

        * The team will need to collectively fill out and submit a Budget, using the Budget Template

        * Each team member should be asked to fill out a pre-class survey

            * Sent through UCF Qualtrics account

            * This is not a required document for receiving funds and/or participating in the program, however teams should be encouraged to submit

* There should be a portion of the pre-class workshop, or a separate session, specifically for documents.

    * Teams are required to fill out and sign all documents, gather a list of supplies and materials needed for MVP development, and a list of events and places they plan to attend for customer discovery.

    * Teams will bring in all materials to the document workshop, and will be guided through filling out the PTF and budget.

    * All documents from each individual, from each team, should be received by I-Corps staff by the end of the documents workshop.

* All documents, including budget and PTF, should be submitted before class 1 begins
