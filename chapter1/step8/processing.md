### Processing

* Each PI will need to submit a Research ID number. This  number appears on screen directly after submitting the PTF form.

* Each teamâ€™s budget will need to be reviewed and approved. The items on the budget must be checked to ensure funds are only being spent on customer development and/or MVP development.

    * If the dates for any events (conferences, trade shows, etc.) go past the period of performance (end date for the account), the account will need to be extended or the budget should be revised by the team and re-submitted.
