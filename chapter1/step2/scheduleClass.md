### Schedule and Set Up Classes

The number of classes has varied from 4 weeks to 10 weeks, so you will want to check with the teaching team to see what the current format is. There will be one class every week, typically on Friday mornings. The class should be approximately 4 hours in length. The class starts with a 30 minute Q&A on the previous week’s material, followed by 3 hours of presentations by teams on lessons learned from previous week of customer interviews, followed by a 30 minute lecture on the upcoming week’s materials.

* Identify the number of weeks for this cohort

* Reserve a room for all weeks of class

    * Elevated room so Teaching Team can sit in back and observe teams

        * E.g. Classroom Building 2 – Room 204

* Identify topics (BMC segment) to be discussed in each week

    * Last week is Final Presentations

* Identify instructors for each week

    * The lecture at the beginning of the class will be a Q&A on the previous weeks material, so you will want to assign the beginning of class lecturer who taught that material the previous week

    * The end of the class lecture is on a new topic, so you will want to assign a new Teaching Team member (not the one who led the Q&A in the beginning of class).

    * To assign Teaching Team members as lecturers, check their schedules for all weeks, as well as what topic they covered last time, if any.

        * If schedule permits, assign the lecturer to the same topic they led in a previous cohorts

        * Make sure each Teaching Team member has approved their days to Instruct, and that they have it reserved on their calendar
