### Update Syllabus

The syllabus should detail all material teams will need for the classes. It should contain:

* Contact information for the TA and Teaching Team members

* A section for each class, including:

    * The topic of the class (i.e. Business Model Canvas segment)

    * The lecturer for the beginning of class Q&A for each class

    * The lecturer for the end of class lecture

    * The homework that needs to be completed for each class

        * Readings

            * Startup Owner’s Manual: pages for each class

            * Business Model Generation: pages for each class

            * Supplementary readings (e.g. blog posts)

        * Viewings

            * Steve Blank Udacity Lectures

            * Supplementary videos

        * Number of interviews for the week leading up to class

            * Typically 10-15 per week

        * Presentation format

            * The topic and format of the presentation should reflect the topic (BMC segment) of the homework in the week leading up to that class, and the topic of the lecture from the previous week’s end of class lecture (should be same as homework topic)

* Agenda for the pre-class workshop

* Detail on the final week (lessons learned)

    * Final Presentations

    * Final Videos

* A schedule detailing the room number, dates, times, topics and lecturers for each class
