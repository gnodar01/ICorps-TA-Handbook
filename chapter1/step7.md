## Step 7: Set Up Document Platform

* Set up a Google Drive, or Dropbox, or any similar platform

* Create a folder for Teams, labeled by Cohort number

    * Create subfolders for each Team, labeled by their team number followed by their team name

        * These are the folders teams will use to upload their presentations and final video

* Create a folder for Teaching Team (or use the previous cohort’s teaching team folder)

    * Make this a private or invite-only folder (so it cannot be publicly accessed)

    * Place all slides for the Teaching Team’s Lectures and Q&As in this folder

        * After each class, the slide decks for that week should be linked to from the Resource Hub within LPC

* Create a folder for Resources (or use the previous cohort’s resources folder)

    * Make this a private or invite-only folder (so it cannot be publicly accessed)

    * In this folder, put any resources that will be posted on the Resource Hub within LPC.

        * Examples: Document FAQs, Talking to Humans EBook, Syllabus, Class Schedule, Office Hours sign-up sheet, link to surveys, Final Video and Presentation guide, List of contacts, Mentor slides, Educator’s Handbook, Mentor Handbook, Presentation Upload Guide, Next Steps Guide, etc.
