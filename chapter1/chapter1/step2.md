# Step 2: Finalize Schedule and Curriculum
## Schedule and Set Up Pre-Class Workshop
The Pre-Class workshop serves as an introduction to I-Corps. This workshop will typically take place one or two weeks before class 1, depending on the length of the workshop, and the lessons learned from previous cohorts. Elements may include:

* Overview of Business Model Canvas
* What we now know / How we got here
* Customer Discovery
  * How to identify potential customers
  * How to conduct interviews
  * Creating scripts
  * Holding a mock interview, and/or bringing in a real customer for a team, and having the team interview the customer live
* LPC Walk through
* Value Proposition
* Customer Segments
* Product-Market Fit
* Mentor workshop
  * Mentors go in separate room and learn how to engage with their teams, and ways in which they should be helping
* Team Roles
  * Role of PI
  * Role of EL
* Norms, expectations, and requirements for this class
 
You will want to make sure that a room is booked for the length of the workshop, well in advance. Also plan to serve snacks, water, coffee, food, etc. depending on the length of the workshop.

## Schedule and Set Up Classes
The number of classes has varied from 4 weeks to 10 weeks, so you will want to check with the teaching team to see what the current format is. There will be one class every week, typically on Friday mornings. The class should be approximately 4 hours in length. The class starts with a 30 minute Q&A on the previous week’s material. After Q&A, there are 3 hours of presentations by teams on lessons learned from the previous week of customer interviews. The class ends with a 30 minute lecture on the upcoming week’s materials.

* Identify the number of weeks for this cohort
* Reserve a room for all weeks of class
  * Elevated room so Teaching Team can sit in back and observe teams
    * E.g. Classroom Building 2 – Room 204
* Identify topics (BMC segment) to be discussed in each week
  * Last week is Final Presentations
* Identify instructors for each week
  * The lecture at the beginning of the class will be a Q&A on the previous weeks material. This Q&A should be led by the teching team member who taught the previous week's material at the end of class.
  * The end of the class lecture is on a new topic, so you will want to assign a new Teaching Team member (not the one who led the Q&A in the beginning of class).
  * To assign Teaching Team members as lecturers, check their schedules for all weeks, as well as what topic they covered last time, if any.
    * If schedule permits, assign the lecturer to the same topic they led in a previous cohorts
    * Make sure each Teaching Team member has approved their days to Instruct, and that they have it reserved on their calendar
