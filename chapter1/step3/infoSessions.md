### Information Sessions

* Organize 2 info sessions/pizza mixers. Each should last 2 hours (ideally in the early evening), and they should be held on different days of the week.

* Create an agenda for the information session. Agenda may include:

    * I-Corps overview & video

    * Introduction to teaching team

    * Alumni Panel â€“ invite students and faculty from past classes to talk about their experiences (as early as you can, preferably 2-3 weeks *before* the info session).

    * Team matchmaking

        * First, go around the room and have each student introduce him/herself by pitching background + interests + idea + team member skills/expertise needed

        * Second, have students freely mix!

* Organize food & drinks for all attendees of information session.

* *Book room(s) well in advance*

* On the day of & night before information sessions, send the schedule to the teaching team with details on location and time of office hours as a reminder.

* Information sessions are on a walk-in basis (open to public), but an event sign-up list should still be set up for the event in order to capture emails, names, and other info on interested individuals for future outreach

    * Eventbrite has worked well as a sign-up system

* On the day of the session, make sure each attendee is handed an application

    * Not required to completely fill out application, just preliminary information along with contact info

    * Try to get as many attendees to fill out the application and turn in before leaving
