## Step 3: Recruit Teams

### Planning

* Scan the UCF calendar and set up dates for the following deadlines:

    * 2 Information Session dates (see below for more details)

    * Team applications submission date

    * Team final interviews date

* Make sure the dates chosen do not coincide with any holidays or major school events (e.g. spring break, finals, football games, etc.)

### Website

* Create/update the class website ([http://icorps.cie.ucf.edu/](http://icorps.cie.ucf.edu/)) with all relevant details, including:

    * Course and teaching team overview

    * Application process & important dates

    * Team application

### Information Sessions

* Organize 2 info sessions/pizza mixers. Each should last 2 hours (ideally in the early evening), and they should be held on different days of the week.

* Create an agenda for the information session. Agenda may include:

    * I-Corps overview & video

    * Introduction to teaching team

    * Alumni Panel – invite students and faculty from past classes to talk about their experiences (as early as you can, preferably 2-3 weeks *before* the info session).

    * Team matchmaking

        * First, go around the room and have each student introduce him/herself by pitching background + interests + idea + team member skills/expertise needed

        * Second, have students freely mix!

* Organize food & drinks for all attendees of information session.

* Book room(s) well in advance.

* On the day of & night before information sessions, send the schedule to the teaching team with details on location and time of office hours as a reminder.

* Information sessions are on a walk-in basis (open to public), but an event sign-up list should still be set up for the event in order to capture emails, names, and other info on interested individuals for future outreach

    * Eventbrite has worked well as a sign-up system

* On the day of the session, make sure each attendee is handed an application

    * Not required to completely fill out application, just preliminary information along with contact info

    * Try to get as many attendees to fill out the application and turn in before leaving

### Marketing

* A week before the first info session, create marketing materials (posters, e-mails, flyers, etc.) introducing the class, teaching team, and all necessary details for information session, & link to website. Engage the entire teaching team for history of previous marketing materials and feedback.

* Create or update an organized spreadsheet to track all departments/groups/lists that you market the information session and I-Corps program out to.

*  Update this document periodically. If any groups are missing, reach out to them. Target any STEM related or entrepreneurship based clubs & groups, including but not limited to:

    * All of CS

    * All Engineering departments

    * PhDs in any engineering field

    * CEO Knights

    * Knight Hacks

    * Alpha Kappa Psi Business Fraternity (AKPsi)

    * Graduate Business Programs

    * UCF Sales Club

    * Young Investors Club

    * UCF College of Medicine

* Gather names, e-mails, and possible complete or incomplete applications of interested individuals/teams

* Be sure to target these groups in advance, as well as send out a reminder the day of the event to maximize attendance

### Forming Teams

Teams with missing ELs or PIs should be assisted in finding someone who will fulfill those roles.

### Team Tracking

Set up an excel spreadsheet or database to keep track of all interested individuals and applicant teams. This should include, where applicable:

* Name

* E-mail

* Phone number

* Technology/Innovation

* Status

    * Interested, incomplete team application submitted, complete team application received, etc.

* The individual's role (PI, EL, Mentor)

* The individual’s affiliation or department

* Team name
