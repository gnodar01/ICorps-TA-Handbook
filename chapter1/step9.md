## Step 9: Team Outreach

### Linkedin

Add each individual from each team to the UCF I-Corps Linkedin account.This will serve as an additional touchpoint for marketing, as well as a method to gather metrics during and after the cohort ends.

### Pre-Workshop E-mail

After the document package has been sent out, teams should be sent an email introducing them to the I-Corps program. This email should contain:

* Syllabus with class schedule (including room numbers for workshop and class as well as dates for each)

* Talking to Humans ebook

* A reminder to log in to the LPC

* Workshop agenda (this should also be in the syllabus)

* A reminder to have all materials, information, and documents prepared for the document workshop (which may be a separate workshop, or a section of the pre-class workshop)

* A list of material that should be read through, watched and completed before the pre-class workshop
