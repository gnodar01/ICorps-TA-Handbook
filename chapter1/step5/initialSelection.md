### Initial Applicant Selection

* The final selection committee should receive approximately 16 applicant teams, so that they may narrow down to 8 or 9 final teams.

* If there are more than 16 applications received during a cohort, I-Corps staff should review and select 16 "semi-finalist teams" to move on to the selection process.

    * There should be several teams chosen as "backup teams", in case any of the selected 16 teams drop out or are unable to commit.

* If less than 16 complete team applications are received, there will need to be a discussion on whether a selection committee will be needed.
