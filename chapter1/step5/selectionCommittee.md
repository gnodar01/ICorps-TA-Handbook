### Selection Committee

* Make sure a date is picked for the final selection process, and that a room is booked. The room should be large enough to fit the selection committee, the presenting team, and I-Corps staff. The room should also have A/V equipment.

* Each team will need to have a time slot reserved for them; e-mail each team with the date, location, and time of their presentation.

* Make sure there will be food and drinks available for the selection committee.

* Make sure the individuals comprising the selection committee are finalized. Typically the selection committee is put together by a member of the Teaching Team.

* Each member of the selection committee should be e-mailed the date for the final selection process, the location of the room, the rubric which they will be using to judge teams, and a list of the presenting teams, along with each teamâ€™s application.

* Before selection day, make sure all of the presentations from the teams have been received.

* On selection day, before the committee arrives, check all equipment, and load all presentations.

* Keeping time for the presentations will be important. Keep teams and the selection committee aware of the time, and make sure it is being adhered to.
