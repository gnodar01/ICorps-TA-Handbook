## Step 5: Selection Process

Each cohortâ€™s applicant teams will be selected down to 8-9 final teams. There will be a selection committee who will be comprised of experienced entrepreneurs, VCs, business leaders, etc. Teams will present their innovations/technologies to the selection committee, who will then select the top 8 or 9 to take part in I-Corps.
