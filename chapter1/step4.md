## Step 4: Recruit Mentors

Goal: after the teams are selected (~four weeks before class starts,) the Teaching Team and TA’s recruit mentors.

***First Choice:*** Mentors who are excited about contributing can unequivocally devote time each week to attend class, engage with the team during the week, and get or will invest the time in learning the process.

***Second Choice:*** Relevant domain experience

***Close Second Choice:*** Mentors with entrepreneurial experience, who get Lean and are relentless at Customer Discovery

***Last Choice:*** Mentors who feel like they were doing you a favor.

* Tap the current mentor network

    * Includes mentors from previous cohorts

* Create a spreadsheet to keep track of all individuals who express interest to be a mentor.

* With the teaching team, formulate the expectations of a mentor (e.g. involvement level, domain experience, etc). Send the list of expectations to all individuals who expressed interest in getting involved in the class, and ask how much they can commit in order to find if they are a better fit as a mentor for the class.

* Goal: one mentor per team. Ideally, we have 8-9 mentors for the 8-9 teams.

* In spreadsheet, provide background on each of the teams that were accepted to our class. Add names of team members, mission of team, industry/sector of mission, emails of team members, etc. Send this information to all mentors of the class, and have them privately provide you their preferences on which teams to mentor.

* With these preferences, assign one mentor to each team. Keep in mind each mentor’s sector/industry of expertise in this decision-making process.

* Email all mentors the Mentor Handbook. In the email, make sure to clearly specify the dates/time/location of the first mentor workshop & our first day of class.

* Make sure you set mentors up on LaunchPad Central

* Obtain parking passes for the workshop and each week of class
