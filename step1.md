#Step 1: Reflect, Gather Feedback, and Strategize.
 
* Talk to previous TA (if different from this time), and identify their process.

* Read course feedback from previous cohort’s post-class surveys.

* Gather feedback from the teaching team (and if possible mentors) on last year's experience. (The teaching team often writes up a “Lessons-Learned Document” as a class post-mortem. Ask if one exists).

* Create an action plan based on all feedback gathered – things to change & things to keep the same. Use this to plan the course ahead.
