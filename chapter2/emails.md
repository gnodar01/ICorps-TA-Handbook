## Emails

### Beginning of the Week E-mail to Students

* Reading for the week, taken from syllabus

* Presentation format for the week, taken from the syllabus

* Detailed explanation on what the presentation for the upcoming class should include, and which parts are the most important (e.g. quickly iterate to the lessons learned, and hypotheses validated/invalidated)

* Reminder that the presentation should be uploaded to Google Drive (or whichever system is used, such as Dropbox), and the presentation should be linked to from within LaunchPad Central

* Reminder that presentations are due a day before class

* A link to the Team's Folder, which they will use to upload presentations and final video

* Videos to watch for the week, taken from the syllabus

* Announcements, logistics, updates, etc. (should be kept to minimum so that the e-mail can be as concise as possible)

### Send the Mentors/Advisors Weekly Email

After each class, send mentors a weekly email summarizing what their teams should be doing. The emails are accompanied by a short set of already-made PowerPoint slides summarizing the weeks learning for the class.

The mentors are your "deputies" and keeping them up to speed is the best defense against excessive train wrecks. To do that, the mentors have to keep up (ideally ahead) in the readings and the Course video lectures as well. Repeat for all classes.

#### In the Mentor E-mail

* List the week’s learning materials

    * Readings

    * Videos

    * BMC Segment

* Attach the week’s mentor update slides

* Share any logistics, announcements, etc.
