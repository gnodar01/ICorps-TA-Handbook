## Pre and Post Class Logistics

### LPC Setup

* Before each class, upload any documents into the Resource Hub pertaining to the upcoming week and/or class

* Directly after each class, go into LPC and set up the next week’s Presentations by clicking Create New Presentations

* Directly after each class, upload the Lecture and Q&A slides from that class into the Resource Hub

### Collect Team Presentations

* Before Class, collect team’s slides beforehand so no individual computer setup is necessary, then load them on a single presentation computer (the presentations should be uploaded and linked to in LPC)

    * Deadline should be before class, but many students make final edits and upload the presentation in class.

    * Pre-load the slides on a single presentation computer (usually done in class, 30 minutes before class begins)

* Directly after each class, download all of the team’s presentation and store them on the network drive

    * Multiple people have access to Google Drive/Dropbox, and many times someone will accidentally delete/modify other team’s files, so it is important to be diligent on keeping copies of everything on the network drive

    * In case something is deleted/modified before a copy can be downloaded, both Google Drive and Dropbox have revision control systems, so deleted documents and earlier versions of documents can be recovered

### LPC Monitoring

Throughout the week, make sure teams are logging all interviews (with detailed notes), logging Instructor Engagements, logging Mentor Engagements, filling out their canvases, validating and invalidating hypotheses, and watching videos. Email teams and put them on notice if not. Inform instructors if it continues past one week.

### Preflight Classroom Logistics

Ensure that *projectors, screens, Wi-Fi, break rooms, microphones, recording equipment, presentation computer, speakers, etc*. are in place and are in working order

### Final Class

* In the beginning of the final class the post-class survey should be handed out to each individual to fill out and submit in class.

    * These surveys should be scanned, uploaded and stored in the I-Corps folder

* Directly after the final class, each team’s videos should be downloaded from their folders

    * Upload the final videos to the I-Corps YouTube channel, in a playlist for that cohort

* Each individual should be encouraged to set up a meeting with the Venture Accelerator for their next steps after I-Corps
