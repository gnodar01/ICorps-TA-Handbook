## Cohort Management

### Team Management â€“ Throughout the Quarter

Ideally, during the quarter each team needs to be monitored on progress and assisted with solving any issues. These include team member discord, team member slacking off, and mentor unavailability. Any problems should be brought forward to the teaching team or directly to the mentors for the various issues.
