#### Things to Monitor

* Customer discovery progress – how are they doing? Do they need help with contacts? Are they all participating? Are they just talking to UCF students or really getting out of the building?

* Minimal Viable Product (MVP) progress – teams need to do discovery + build an MVP. Are they doing both? With enough progress?

* Team dynamics – are their individuals not pulling their weight? Team conflicts? How do they make decisions? Note if the MBA’s are dominating the teams (if there has been an MBA assigned as EL).

* Mentor Interaction- are they talking to their mentors at least once a week? Is the mentor helpful? Any issues?
