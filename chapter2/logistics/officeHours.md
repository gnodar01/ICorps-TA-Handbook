## Office Hours

### Each Week

The teaching team has mandatory office hours for teams every week (except the first and last weeks) to provide course corrections and uncover the inevitable team dynamics issues.

* Remind teams that they need to be at least a week ahead in scheduling their mandatory office hours.

    * This may require the TA to reach out to certain teams to wrangle them into available slots. We have found it best to make office hours mandatory, and have teams rotate through the teaching team members to get different perspectives on their progress.

* Manage Office Hours: set up and maintain a student and room scheduling and signup sheet on Google Docs (or any suitable system)

    * When a team signs up for a slot, they will need to email the teaching team member and coordinate the logistics of the meeting (how the meeting will be conducted: Skype, phone, in-person; and if in-person, where the meeting will be conducted)

        * Have teams CC you on these communications

    * Send a meeting invite to the teaching team member and team to ensure they have it on their calendars

    * Before the meeting, email the teaching team member as an additional reminder

* Remember that remote office hours can be extremely effective for teams, mentors, and faculty. Lots of mentors prefer weekend times for their mentor-team meetings, and in some cases this alternative may be worth considering for faculty-team meetings as well. This is especially true toward the end of the class, when there is a mad scramble to pull it all together for the final presentations and videos.
