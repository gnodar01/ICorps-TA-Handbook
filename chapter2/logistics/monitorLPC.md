### LPC Monitoring

Throughout the week, make sure teams are logging all interviews (with detailed notes), logging Instructor Engagements, logging Mentor Engagements, filling out their canvases, validating and invalidating hypotheses, and watching videos. Email teams and put them on notice if not. Inform instructors if it continues past one week.
