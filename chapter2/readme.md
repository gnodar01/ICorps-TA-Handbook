# During the Quarter

The goal during the quarter is to ensure all aspects of the class are being enacted, monitored and communicated. You will need to engage with the Teams, Mentors, and Teching team and ensure all are notified of any logistics, updates, resources, documents, announcements or requirements during the cohort.
