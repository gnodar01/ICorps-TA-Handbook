## Cohort Management

### Team Management – Throughout the Quarter

Ideally, during the quarter each team needs to be monitored on progress and assisted with solving any issues. These include team member discord, team member slacking off, and mentor unavailability. Any problems should be brought forward to the teaching team or directly to the mentors for the various issues.

#### Things to Monitor

* Customer discovery progress – how are they doing? Do they need help with contacts? Are they all participating? Are they just talking to UCF students or really getting out of the building?

* Minimal Viable Product (MVP) progress – teams need to do discovery + build an MVP. Are they doing both? With enough progress?

* Team dynamics – are their individuals not pulling their weight? Team conflicts? How do they make decisions? Note if the MBA’s are dominating the teams (if there has been an MBA assigned as EL).

* Mentor Interaction- are they talking to their mentors at least once a week? Is the mentor helpful? Any issues?

#### Safety/Culture

Immediately alert the instructors to any student reports of abuse or harassment

Let instructors know about team issues – business or interpersonal
