## In-Class

### During Each Weekly Class Session

* Load the presentations

* Manage the order of presentations and keep the teams on their allotted presentation time

    * Have a timer set up and facing the presenting team.

        * This timer should keep track of how long the team has on their presentation (8 minutes total)

        * When this timer reaches zero, the team should move on to the 4 minute Q&A

    * Hold signs up for 5 minutes remaining and 2 minutes remaining

        * These signs should be double sided, so that both the Teaching Team and Presenting Team can see the amount of time remaining

        * These signs refer to *total* time left in the presentation (12 minutes total)

            * The five minute sign should be held up at minute 7

            * The two minute sign should be held up at minute 10

    * After their 12 minutes are up, switch off the projector, load the next teamâ€™s presentation, and have the next team come up

        * The entire team should come to the front, including Mentor

* Teams should have a dedicated team member taking notes on any verbal comments made by the Teaching Team during their presentation

* Remind teams in the audience that they need to be providing the presenting teams with their critiques on LaunchPad Central (grades and comments)
