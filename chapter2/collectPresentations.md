### Collect Team Presentations

* Before Class, collect team’s slides beforehand so no individual computer setup is necessary, then load them on a single presentation computer (the presentations should be uploaded and linked to in LPC)

    * Deadline should be before class, but many students make final edits and upload the presentation in class.

    * Pre-load the slides on a single presentation computer (usually done in class, 30 minutes before class begins)

* Directly after each class, download all of the team’s presentation and store them on the network drive

    * Multiple people have access to Google Drive/Dropbox, and many times someone will accidentally delete/modify other team’s files, so it is important to be diligent on keeping copies of everything on the network drive

    * In case something is deleted/modified before a copy can be downloaded, both Google Drive and Dropbox have revision control systems, so deleted documents and earlier versions of documents can be recovered
