### Send the Mentors/Advisors Weekly Email

After each class, send mentors a weekly email summarizing what their teams should be doing. The emails are accompanied by a short set of already-made PowerPoint slides summarizing the weeks learning for the class.

The mentors are your "deputies" and keeping them up to speed is the best defense against excessive train wrecks. To do that, the mentors have to keep up (ideally ahead) in the readings and the Course video lectures as well. Repeat for all classes.

#### In the Mentor E-mail

* List the week’s learning materials

    * Readings

    * Videos

    * BMC Segment

* Attach the week’s mentor update slides

* Share any logistics, announcements, etc.
